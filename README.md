# Serverless Security Automation & Remediation (Advanced Cloud Security)

## 🚀 Overview
This project, started on July 19, 2025, showcases a serverless solution using AWS Lambda to detect and remediate security misconfigurations across AWS services (e.g., S3, EC2). Built with Python/Boto3, it leverages AWS Security Hub, CloudWatch Events, and SNS for real-time automation and alerts.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Automated detection of public S3 buckets, misconfigured IAM roles, and more
- Serverless remediation with Lambda functions
- Real-time notifications via SNS/Slack
- Logging of actions to an S3 audit bucket

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- AWS Lambda, Python, Boto3
- AWS Security Hub, CloudWatch Events
- SNS, S3 (for auditing)
- Terraform (for initial setup)
