# Serverless Security Automation & Remediation (Advanced Cloud Security)

## 🚀 Overview
This project showcases a serverless solution using AWS Lambda to detect and remediate security misconfigurations in AWS environments — such as public S3 buckets. Built with Python/Boto3, it leverages CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and SNS for real-time automation, logging, and alerts.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Automated detection of insecure public S3 buckets
- Lambda-driven serverless remediation logic
- Real-time threat alerts via SNS
- Logging of remediation actions to a dedicated S3 audit bucket

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- AWS Lambda, Python, Boto3
- CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty
- SNS, S3 (for audit logs)
- Terraform (for infrastructure as code)

## 📖 Lessons Learned
- Built a fully serverless cloud security automation pipeline
- Improved skills in Lambda event handling and IAM permissions
- Gained hands-on experience in real-time detection and response workflows

## 🙋🏽‍♂️ About Me
I’m a cloud security enthusiast focused on building practical, hands-on skills in AWS security, automation, and incident response.
